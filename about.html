        <h3>AghogbanPhinehas</h3>
    </ul>
     My name is Aghogban Phinehas. I am 17 years old. I was born on the 8th of July 2008. My favourite food is pasta. Any kind is good enough for me,be it spaghetti, maccaroni, twists, etc. I love watching anime because it helps me escape reality. I don't really like making friends but I have some though. I have a phobia for baloons, well that's what my parents say. I'm not afraid of baloons I just really hate the popping sound. I have scoliosis so I always feel uncomfortable and keep to myself. I dislike when people touch me especially on my back cuz it's really uncomfortable. I always wear a jacket on everything I wear. I'm currently in a coding class. Stay safe guys.
